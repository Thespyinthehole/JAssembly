# Commenting

In the `.jasm` file, you are able to comment the code by using `#`. This will comment out everything on the current line after the symbol. Comments can also take up the whole line as well. These can be in any section of the file including both the constant declaration and main code sections.

## Examples

* `MOV m0 10 #Moves 10 into memory location 0`


* `#This line does nothing`
