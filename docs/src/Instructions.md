# Instructions

The code base is made up of line seperated instructions, with each instruction being made up of an opcode followed by operands. The number of operands will be determined by the opcode, which will be explain later on. The opcode and operands need to be white space seperated, you can use as much or as little white space as needed. The format of an instruction is: `<opcode> <operand> <operand>`, where the operands are optional.

## Examples

*  `MOV m0 10`

*  `ADD r0 5`

*  `HALT`
